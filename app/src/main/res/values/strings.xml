    <string name="recomen0">Do not rush with the test, once again go to the instructions section, learn and practice in the training session.</string>
    <string name="recomen1">An error occurred during the last calculation. Repeat the solution in the instructions section.</string>
    <string name="recomen2">Most likely, the answer is incorrect because of an error during the solution, and not in the last calculation.</string>
    <string name="recomenYS">Repeat the way of finding the DA in the instructions section. Maybe you forgot to take into mind that the DA sign must correspond to the WA sign (if the HC is greater than 180, then subtract 360).</string>
    <string name="recomenYV">If you have a mistake at this point, then learn some arithmetic. You must subtract the SMTA from the ßn. Usually WA is calculated in the range [-180; 180]</string>
    <string name="recomenUekv">Errors at this point can only be due to inattention. Simple arithmetic. It is necessary to remember that it you need to subtract V from W, and not vice versa.</string>
    <string name="recomenYV2">Repeat in the instructions section to find the WA. Perhaps you simply forgot that the WA sign must correspond to the DA sign.</string>
    <string name="recomenBen">It is important not to get confused and remember that when W is greater than V and W is less than V, calculations are performed differently.</string>
    <string name="recomenBen1">Errors at this point can only be due to inattention. Simple arithmetic and understanding that ßm lies within [0.360) degrees.</string>
    <string name="recomenHbar">Check whether you have calculated Hbar in the correct units. Do not forget to take into mind the sign.</string>
    <string name="recomendH">Simple arithmetic. Make sure that all signs are taken into account and everything is in the same units of measure.</string>
    <string name="recomentpr">Check the unit of measure. Refer to the instructions section.</string>
    <string name="recomendH1">It must be remembered that only H1 from Hfl is subtracted here. Hbar accounting only goes into ▲ H2.</string>
    <string name="recomendH2">It is important to remember that you do not need to subtract from Hfl, but from H1. Check if the Hbar is calculated correctly. Refer to the instructions section.</string>
    <string name="recomenSnach">The calculation goes as in the previous tasks. Refer to the instructions.</string>
    <string name="recomendHsht">It is important to remember that there are two options for calculating, with Hset is greater than Htran.lvl and when Hset is less than Htran.lvl If there are limitations at the aerodrome, then this calculation probably should not be done at all (with Hset greater than H1).</string>
    <string name="recomenSrasp">It is necessary not to confuse and subtract correctly Sset from S.</string>
    <string name="recomendVsh">According to the table in the instructions section you need to approximate this value. You can take an integer. It must be remembered that it is not selected by Vtr, but by Vinstr or Vinstr.corr. You also need to remember that ▲ Vcompr is always negative.</string>
    <string name="recomenVprisp">Arithmetic. Do not forget about the accounting of signs of amendments.</string>
    <string name="recomenVprisp2">Repeat the calculation method for the ruler in the instructions section.</string>
    <string name="recomenVprispKYS">Arithmetic. Do not forget about the accounting of signs of amendments.</string>
    <string name="recomenDP">Arithmetic. Do not forget that the AA lies in the interval [-180; 180].</string>
    <string name="recomenLBY">Do not forget about the sign of the AA, it depends on the sign of CL.</string>
    <string name="recomenBY">LD sign corresponds to the AA sign. Not to be confused about what to divide: you need divide S remaining to the S passed.</string>

    <string name="Ob0">Greetings! Now I will make a short tour of the application so that you are not lost. Lets start from top. Touch the screen.</string>
    <string name="Ob1">In the "store" you can purchase the full version of the application, disable ads and find out the developer’s contacts for communication.</string>
    <string name="Ob2">In the "NL-10" you can use the virtual NL-10.</string>
    <string name="Ob3">In the "tasks" section, you can use the calculator of aeronautical tasks, the task designer for training and the training and test of tasks. You can see instructions for solving each task using NL-10 in the instructions section.</string>
    <string name="Ob4">In the "waiting area" section, you can see the visualization and tasks for entering the waiting area.</string>
    <string name="Ob5">In the "LZP test" you can practice the ability to determine the position of the aircraft relative to the LZP. Read how to do this in the instructions section, the last paragraph.</string>
    <string name="Ob6">In the "wind calculation" you can see the lateral and longitudinal components of the wind for your strip.</string>
    <string name="Ob7">In the "statistics" menu, you record your successes and failures in solving problems in the "test" item.</string>
    <string name="Ob8">Have fun learning! For all questions and suggestions, please contact here: maximarius78@gmail.com.</string>

    <string name="descrtask18_5">It remains only to fold the AA and the LD and we will get a AC.</string>

    <string name="descrtask19_1">This task is located in a separate menu item. Here you need to determine as soon as possible where the aircraft is located relative to the ITL, having data of the SMTA, MC and CAR. First you need to determine the aircraft is flying on or off to RS. To do this, look at the value of the CAR. If the CAR is from 270° to 360° or from 0° to 90°, then this is a flight on the RS, if the CAR is more than 90°, but less than 270°, then this is a flight from the RS.</string>
    <string name="descrtask19_2">Now, in order to determine the position of the AC relative to the LZP, we compare the SMTA and the sum of MC+CAR. Below you can see where the aircraft will be depending on the comparison results for the flight on the RS.</string>
    <string name="descrtask19_3">And for a flight from the RS.</string>

    <string name="descrtask20_1">To begin with, lets understand the controls:\n1-indication of the heading of the aircraft, when entering values ​​through the keyboard, the course will be automatically set according to the entered data;\n2-indication of the course of landing, it is the course of the approach line, when entering values ​​through the keyboard, the course will be automatically set according to the entered data; \n3,4-buttons for switching the circle to the left and right; \n5-button for entering the test mode, where you are asked to solve tasks of determining the type of entry into the HP; \n6-button for instructions that you clicked to get here; \n7-circular indication of the course of landing and sectors of entry into the HP; \ n8-circular indication of the course of the aircraft.</string>
    <string name="descrtask20_2">So, guidance is provided when flying with inbound course using navigation tools that are located at the Holding Fix (red triangle). The turn is performed with a roll, providing an angular speed of turning 3 °/sec with a roll not exceeding 25°. Flight time with the outbound course at altitudes up to FL140 is 1 minute, and 1.5 minutes above. Entry to the holding pattern is possible from any direction involving 3 sectors. The line passing through the HF and dividing the airspace into sectors passes at an angle of 70 ° to the inbound course.\n__________________________________\nENTRANCE FROM SECTOR I (parallel)\n1) After the passage of HF, the flight is parallel to inbound course during the set time\n2) U-turn is performed into the protected area with the obligatory intersection of the inbound course\n3) A turn is made with an exit to the inbound course and after the repeated flight through HF, the flight is performed according to the pattern.</string>
    <string name="descrtask20_3">ENTRANCE FROM SECTOR II (teardrop) \n1) After the flight through a HF, a flight is performed inside the protected area at an angle of 30° to the inbound course during a specified time \n2) A reversal is performed with an exit to the inbound course \n3) After a repeated flight through the HF, the flight is performed according to the pattern.</string>
    <string name="descrtask20_4">ENTRANCE FROM SECTOR III (direct entrance) 1) After the flight through a HF, a flight is performed according to the pattern.</string>

Or maybe you have forgotten that in order to search for a magnetic course, it is necessary to calculate the WA through the SMTA, and not the SATA.</string>
